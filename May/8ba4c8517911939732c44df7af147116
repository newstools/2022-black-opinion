By Andile Mngxitama Cde Zwane was driving Radical Economic Transformation (RET) hard! For this Stellenbosch shall never forgive him. Under the political leadership of President Zuma, he clearly announced the RET Mining Charter which gave blacks 30% of the mines within a year. The 30% was split thus: 14% BEE, 8% workers, 8% communities! Also it provides for 70% procurement of mining goods and 80% procurement of services from BEE entities. It further requires that analysis of 100% of mineral samples be done by South African based companies. At Junior Management level it requires a minimum of 88% black representation, 44% of which must be female.A smart feature of the Charter was that 1% of annual miming “turn over” be allocated to blacks in cash. This would have ensured money in their pockets, not paper empowerment.I had the privilege of working with Cde Zwane. The lawyers representing the community of Xolobeni asked us to get the Minister to stop the murderous Australian companies mining licences. The Minister listened to the community. Another big victory was the granting of mining rights to the Zama Zamas in Kimberly. Again, there we intervened and asked the Minister to help. He didn’t hesitate. Permits were granted to the informal miners.Stellenbosch got a fright when they saw how resolute the comrade was and they started the attacks and vilifications. Don’t let the enemy decide who our leaders are. Much respect Comrade Zwane. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
