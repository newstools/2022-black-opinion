By Andile Mngxitama  There are blacks who grew up on farms yet don’t know that it’s their parents who worked the land to feed the nation. Some of the most mentally enslaved blacks are the sons and daughters of farm workers.  In Zim whites instructed their slaves to oppose land reform on farms. Most farm workers cried tears when land was taken from their bosses. Whiteness destroys the black mind.  Free the mind to free the land!  Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
