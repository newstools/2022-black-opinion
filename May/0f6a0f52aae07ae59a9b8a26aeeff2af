By Andile Mngxitama Despite our best effort to explain, there are blacks who genuinely believe that the Guptas and Zuma are the problem. It makes little difference to explain the Guptas didn’t even control 5% of Eskom tenders. Most blacks are victims of Stellenbosch propagandapushed by the Zondo commission and mass media.BLF gave Zondo evidence of almost R4 billion corruption at Treasury under Pravin. Our complaint never saw the light of day. But ya it’s sad how so many blacks have been turned into Stellembosch zombies. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
