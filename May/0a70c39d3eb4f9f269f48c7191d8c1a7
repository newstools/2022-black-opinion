By Andile Mngxitama Visibly poor, in tears, a black graduate attends the most important event marking their success thus far. Tears witnessed by all move a good sumaritan to offer employment and a bursary. Good deed!The fate of our graduates cannot depend on charity. The graduate has carried his or her part of the deal, society must through a caring State guarantee a job for the graduate. It cannot be a matter of charity, it’s a policy matter.All graduates must be employed as a matter of policy. Gaddafi did it. We can do it too. We must move away from the aggg shame practises to dignified rights for all. There is no reason why there can be no free education and compulsory employment of ALL graduates. Just needs political will. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
