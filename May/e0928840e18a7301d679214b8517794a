By Andile Mngxitama The nursing professionals have a bad rap more so those in public hospitals. I have experienced both spaces and I have nothing but respect and admiration for the nurses. I received top notch care in both spaces. There was love, empathy and high levels of professionalism. I hope the care I received is true for all patients. The nursing staff is the backbone of the healthcare system. Often they are turned into monsters by lack of motivation and bad working conditions. We need to pay the nurses the same amount we give members of parliament. The nurses of Milpark Hospital in the ICU are also highly stylish and eye pleasing. The Bara sisters are mostly motherly. Another time I shall thank the doctors in both hospitals. By the way, my ICU room in Milpark was next to the one where Cde Jackson Mthembu was in. My experience of Milpark doesn’t give credence to the negative sentiments about it. I received high quality care there. The same with Bara’s new ICU facility. It’s of very high standard, new and technologically jerked up. Thanks to the sisters for taking good care of me.
