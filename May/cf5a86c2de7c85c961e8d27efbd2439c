Atul, Rajesh and Ajay Gupta. Credit: Getty Images By Andile Mngxitama One day I shall write a book on the rise and fall of the Guptas, their correct place in our war against white monopoly capital, their influence in running SOEs and compare the performances of these SOEs under their influence and now.Black business has serious lessons to learn from the Guptas. Right now there is no big business on the side of the progressive forces of RET. Stellenbosch is going to easily buy the next ANC conference and retain the leadership of the ANC. The Guptas precipitated a revolutionary moment. It was not about charity, it was about self interest. However, their self interest was not realisable outside fighting for the general empowerment of blacks. The interests of the Guptas were codetermined with those of black progress. We can characterise the family as a faction of the patriotic bourgeoisie. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
