Image: Babalo Ndwayana, black Stellenbosch University student whose books, desk and laptop were urinated on by a white student, Theuns du Toit, on 14 May 2022 after he forcibly gained entry into his room at the campus residence By Andile Mngxitama Black people raised on Madiba diet and colonial christian ethic have a sheepish acceptance of white transgressions. If the offending student was Nigerian, the whole nation would be out with tyres and calling for justice. Whiteness has castrated blacks rage in front of whiteness. We blacks are reduced to peacefull sheep being taken to the slaughterhouse. We need to regain our humanity through fighting! Land or death!!!
