OTSC countries condemned attempts to falsify historical events related to the fight against nazism. They also stressed their intention to continue countering attempts to glorify neo-nazism, racism, and xenophobia. This organization will conduct joint military exercises in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan in the fall to prepare to defend the former Soviet space in the face of the possible accession of Finland and Sweden to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). https://twitter.com/_africansoil/status/1526096302811009024?s=12 “The NATO does not influence in the best way other countries and regions, so its expansion toward our borders requires special attention from us,” Putin said, stressing the Atlantic Alliance serves the interests of U.S. foreign policy. Created in 1992 by the Treaty of Tashkent, OTSC is a joint defense system of 3,600 peacekeeper troops from Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan. This organization’s founding charter reaffirms the abstention from the use or threat of force to resolve mutual conflicts and the obligation to help allies against foreign aggressions. https://twitter.com/telesurenglish/status/1507466444853977090?s=12 Reposted from the telesurenglish website
