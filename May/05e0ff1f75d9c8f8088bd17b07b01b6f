Black First Land First (BLF) is appalled and disturbed by the growing incidents of murder of mostly children by pit bulls. This dog is not a pet, it’s a killer machine. The argument that it’s the owner that’s responsible is not enough. A dog is not a gun, it’s an animal with a mind of its own. Responsible countries have banned or severely limited the ownership of this dangerous animal. The ownership of Pitbulls are banned in the following countries because of potential dangers: Argentina, Parts of Australia, Parts of Austria, Bavaria, Belarus, Parts of Belgium, Bermuda, Parts of Brazil, Parts of China, Parts of Canada, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, 15/16 German provinces, Guyana, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Parts of Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, The UEA, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and Venezuela. There are also laws to limit ownership of or completely outlaw pit bull terriers in the likes of New Zealand, Belgium, France, Denmark, Poland, Finland, and Norway. It’s time we protect our children against this monster dog.
