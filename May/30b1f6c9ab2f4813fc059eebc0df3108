By Andile Mngxitama We black South Africans murder 20 000 of each other annually. A people that is dehumanised doesn’t respect the lives of those that look like them. We blacks are brutalised and dehumanised. That’s why it is so easy to create black on black violence. The enemy knows this and to deflect attention from itself it increases the cycles of black on black violence. We must refuse to hate each other. It’s the first path to liberation. We are at war with our blackness… this must stop! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
