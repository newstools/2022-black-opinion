Image: Steve Biko  By Andile Mngxitama  Steve Biko has described the blackman as a sheepish ox who has accepted his inferiority. Shit scared of the white man the blackman turns to other black men with violence. The defeated black man is particurlaly vicious on the black woman and defenceless children.  Gender based violence amongst blacks is a function of the injured masculinity of the blackman. All black men are mere boys in front of the white man and white woman. The violence we mete out at the black woman is a sign of sickness. Because we feel inadequate, we crave ownership of the black woman. We play the role of psuedo masters because we are owned by the white man.  The black man must be awakened to his state of beastliness created by opprression. He must be made to realise that his manhood shall be restored only upon the defeat of the real man who is right now the white man.  We need to create positive loving and protective musculinities. First step is to recognise what the white system has reduced the black man to. Untill we understand the source of the sickness of the blackman we can’t defeat gender based violence. Key to finding a lasting solution is total liberation and return of the land and economy. Untill then the blackman shall remain a dangerous beast in the mould of the pitbull.  Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
