Image: Screenshot of image from YouTube video  By Andile Mngxitama  The UKZN graduation zulu dance motif is just that, a permitted performance of the native in a colonial setting. They allow us the dance, an ululation on grad day, and it’s back to the colony. It reminds me of the racist Afrikaner town Boksburg, once every September the rules are suspended and the natives from the township are allowed to block one of the main streets and drink, dance, vomit and even shit. However, at 5 am all must leave and the place is restored to its whiteness.  The UKZN grad ceremony is beautifull and satisfying, like the tribal dances we do in our villages when Princess Diana and Bono come to see our poverty. Of course it does suggest a need to decolonise. It can be read as a perfomance of defience without defying. As we keep on saying, “there can be no decolonised university in a colonised society”.  There is substantively no difference between the stiff upper lip British ceremonies of Wits and UCT, and the bright Indlamu dance filled UKZN grads. But hey, let the other children enjoy their grad day with a breakfall and high kick. The struggle is a long story…  Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
