Black First Land First (BLF) welcomes the announcement of a declaration of collaboration between the historical liberation movements, the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) and the Azanian People’s Organisation ( AZAPO). This collaboration is long overdue. We do well to remember that Steve Biko broke his restrictions and was captured and murdered in the quest to unify the liberation movement. The enemy of our people fear nothing more than black unity. BLF congratulates both organisations for their effort towards the unity of the oppressed masses of occupied Azania. We remain committed to the ideal of a fighting Azanian Front that would strike at the enemy as one force. Sobukwe Lives! Biko Lives!Phambili with BLACK UNITY!Phambili with BLACK POWER!Azania shall be free!
