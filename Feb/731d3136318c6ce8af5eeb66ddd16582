Image: BLF President, Andile Mngxitama Dear Black people, we must learn to love ourselves again. Loving ourselves has nothing do with superficial things like how we look, dress etc. Loving ourselves is a much more serious commitment. Loving ourselves is a revolutionary duty. Loving ourselves means learning to know how to deal with politicians who keep misleading us so that they can get crumbs from the table of the oppressor. Loving ourselves means never forgetting who sold us out. But more importantly, loving ourselves means knowing who the enemy is and what it has done since 1652. Loving ourselves means uniting only with those amongst us who are ready to put our collective interests first. Loving ourselves means knowing how much wealth there is in South Africa and who owns it. Loving ourselves means taking back the land God gave us from those who stole it, by any means necessary! Finally, loving ourselves means being free for real. Black love! Love yourself enough to make a revolution! Good morning black people!
