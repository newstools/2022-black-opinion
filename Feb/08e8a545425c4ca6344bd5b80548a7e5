By Andile Mngxitama South Africa is a country of contradictions and hypocrisy where you have a Communist Party which is pro capital and a Marxist Leninists who are in bed with a party of white monopoly capital. The defining truth is that they all speak left but act right. The biggest actual defenders of white monopoly capital are the psuedo left. When the Guptas disrupted the accumulating monopoly of white capital these fake leftists went into tactical alliances with white capital against the Guptas and President Zuma. These formations are here to rescue and serve capital whilst claiming to be at war with it. See how they share funders. As we say, there is really only one main political party in parliament. Don’t listen to what they say. Look at what they do! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
