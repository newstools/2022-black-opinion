Image: President Ramaphosa The Hilbrow Police Station has updated Black First Land First (BLF) on its corruption case against the State President, Cyril Ramaphosa. The Hilbrow Police Station has now transferred the case to Gauteng Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI): PC, which is known as the Hawks. BLF shall be following up with the case on a weekly basis. In the event that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) refuses to prosecute, we will then request access to the docket to ascertain what was investigated by the Hawks and an extensive explanation as to why the NPA refuses to prosecute. We shall not accept the excuse, “not enough evidence to prosecute” as a reason, as we are of the view that the President broke the law. Where necessary, BLF shall institutes private prosecution. There is sufficient evidence that the President broke the law. -END- Issued by Black First Land First,National Coordinating Committee (NCC) Contact DetailsBlack First Land First Mail:blackfirstlandfirst@blf.org.zaGandhi Baai(Secretary General)Cell: +27 73 565 8420Mail: gandhi.baai@blf.org.za For meida enquiries contact:Kabelo Seagiso(Head of Communications)Cell: +27 63 548 2425 Reposted from the BLF website
