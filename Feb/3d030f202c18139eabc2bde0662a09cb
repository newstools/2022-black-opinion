Image: President Ramaphosa President Cyril Ramaphosa will not stop corruption because he is compromised. He is himself involved in acts of criminality for contravening Section 34 of the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act, 2004 in that as a person holding a position of authority who knew of offences that were committed did not report such offences to the police, as he was obliged to do. President Ramaphosa has admitted in an ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting that he and other ANC cadres know that state money has been used in ANC campaigns and that he would rather die than reveal who stole state funds. He further admitted that the practice of vote buying has continued in the ANC. Without addressing President Ramaphosa’s involvement in corruption, we cannot end corruption. Black First Land First (BLF) will submit an affidavit to the police which proves the corruption that the Hawks must investigate. President Ramaphosa will be criminally charged under the following details: Issued by Black First Land First, National Coordinating Committee of (BLF NCC) 7 February 2022 Contact Details Black First Land First Mail: blackfirstlandfirst@blf.org.za Zanele Lwana(BLF Deputy President)Cell: +27 79 986 7225 Kabelo Seagiso(Head of Communications)Cell: +27 63 548 2425 Reposted from the BLF website
