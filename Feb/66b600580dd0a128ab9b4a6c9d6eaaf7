Rob Hersov’s track record of questionable to downright shady business dealings & direct association with a convicted fraudster with a criminal record irks.Rob Hersov is now back in South Africa, & the domestic media reports him as a “Successful Billionaire On A Mission To Save South Africa”. Rob Hersov is leading a campaign to get rid of homeless people in the Capetown suburb of Atlantic Seaboard, & this campaign targets any individual who’s charitable to the homeless, especially women who donate to the homeless. Hersov referred to one such woman as an “evil bitch” and a “monster”, saying he “wanted to find” her. A message was subsequently sent from Hersov’s phone to the woman in question saying: “I know who you are. And a lot more.” Thandi Magweba was such a victim of Rob Hersov’s campaign, & the tyres of her car were slashed. There’s even CCTV video footage of the culprit whom Thandi identified as a local lawyer Gary Trappler who was also part of Hersov’s clique, however the NPA refused to prosecute the matter after Thandi laid charges of malicious damage to property. It must be noted that the Mennel family formed the Urban Foundation NGO with the Oppenheimers & Rupert families. The Urban Foundation payed for Ramaphosa’s law degree studies & Ramaphosa went on to work for the Urban Foundation from 1985 to 1990. End
