Image: Dr Iqbal Surve, CEO of Sekunjalo Group which owns Independent Newspapers The Stellenbosch mafia wants only their voices heard in South Africa. Because they own the banks, they use financial terrorism to shutdown the bank accounts of anyone threatening their agenda. They did this to the Guptas and once they shut them down they spread falsehoods about them in a one sided propaganda war. The Sekunjalo Group has been brave in exposing white monopoly capital corruption including the criminal conduct involved in the R1 billion donations to the CR17 campaign. It was the Sekunjalo Group that broke that story of the capture of the ANC by Stellenbosch. The synchronised decision to shutdown the bank accounts of Sekunjalo is nothing but a well coordinated political attack on the independent media. Stellenbosch can’t stomach any media not singing from its anti black hymn book. Black First Land First (BLF) says Hands Off Dr Iqbal Survé, Hands Off the Sekunjalo Group. We need media diversity in South Africa.
