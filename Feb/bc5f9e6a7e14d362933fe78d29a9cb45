Image: Russian President Vladimir Putin Black First Land First (BLF) stands in solidarity with President Vladimir Putin in defence of the Russian people’s right to peace and dignity. We denounce this brutal war against President Putin and Russia in furtherance of the imperialist agenda of the West and it’s European allies. The U.S. backed NATO is responsible for the crisis in Ukraine for contemptuously violating the Minsk accords intended to end the war in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. To disrespect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Russia and to impeded the otherwise fine relations between the both countries, is a blatant violation of international law. We join the rest of the progressive world in urging a resolution of the problem via diplomatic dialogue. In this context Russia has the indisputable right to defend itself against the U.S. cheered NATO expansion over Ukraine. Hands off President Putin!Hands off the Russian People!Peace between Russia and Ukrain!Down with Imperialism!
