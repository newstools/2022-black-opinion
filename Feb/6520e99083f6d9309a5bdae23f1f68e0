By BO Staff Writer The request by the U.S.-backed Jeanine Añez regime of Bolivia (2019-2020) to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to inquire into supposed crimes against humanity by former President Evo Morales, was denied on 14 February this year. The Añez allegation was that Morales had organized a 12-day roadblock while in exile in Mexico, which ostensibly stopped Bolivians from gaining access to essential healthcare in August 2020. The suggestion was that the conduct of Morales had “the direct consequence of causing the death of several people and anxiety in the rest of the population” that amounted to the crimes against humanity. Karim Khan, ICC Chief Prosecutor, declared that after a thorough probe of the available information he has “determined that the alleged conduct does not satisfy the contextual elements of crimes against humanity”, as indicated in the Rome Statute. In 2019 Morales stepped down from the presidency and went into exile in Mexico to prevent the further persecution of revolutionary leaders in the context of the the U.S.-backed Anez coup. Morales returned to Bolivia in December 2020, after Luis Arce representing Morales’ Movement Towards Socialism (MA) gained victory in the presidential elections winning 55 percent of the votes. “The Bolivian far-right pursue me for having nationalized natural resources and defended our country’s sovereignty. It does not tire of slandering against progressive leaders to eliminate our political influence. Justice, however, will always prevail,” Morales commented. Morales recounts that the protests around that time in question related to the postponement of the elections at the instance of the Añez regime.
