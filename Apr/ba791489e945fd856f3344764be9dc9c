By Andile Mngxitama The interview with DJ Sbu and Penuel The Black Pen has reached 20 000 views. I had a great time on the podcast with brothers who treated me with love and respect. I promised to do a follow up. Panuel has unfinished business, we didn’t debate his association with baas Rob Hersov for instance or his self identification as a God, which I have criticised as a narcissistic turn.We blacks must reason together. I thank DJ Sbu and Panuel for the invite and respectfull engagement. I felt the love.More fire!!! If you missed it, here it is. There’s an error in the date, Juju went to Paarl in 2015 not 2005.Otherwise enjoy… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
