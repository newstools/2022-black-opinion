Andile Mngxitama The late Jazz great Zim Ngqawana once said to me, “people sold Jesus out, who are you to expect any better?” As we enter this great period for those of us who are Christians, it’s time to reflect on the lessons of the cross, betrayal and redemption. We do well to remember Judas was a man of integrity. Upon being exposed he took his own life. Land thieves can learn great lessons from Judas. He returned the blood money and still took.his own life. We can redeem ourselves by doing the right thing… returning the stolen land back to God’s people, as we remèmber the revolutionary Jesus who whipped capitalists for turning the church into a casino and stock exchange. We pray to a fighting God, as we remember the lessons of the cross. Serve, suffer, sacrifice… Izwelethu!
