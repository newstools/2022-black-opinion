Image: Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital medics picketing dismissals It’s a crying shame that the ANC government chooses to let go of over 800 medical professionals at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital. There has also been complaints of shortage of food for patients. This is criminal incompetency and lack of care for black people by this government. Black First Land First (BLF) demands the full employment of the over 800 medical professionals as well as the provision of food and other related services. The medical staff at Chris Hani Baragwanath works very hard to serve the community. They deserve better treatment from the government. BLF reiterates its call for all the politicians and senior government officials to be compelled by law to use public hospitals.
