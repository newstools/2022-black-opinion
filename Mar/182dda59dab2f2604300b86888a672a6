Black First Land First (BLF) honors the 69 protesters who under the leadership of Mangaliso Robert Sobukwe on 21 March 1960 bravely marched against the pass laws and were massacred by the apartheid officials. We note that twenty eight years into democracy, inequality, racism and indignity still plagues our people. The ANC government has sold us the fiction of human rights. It has whitewashed the blood of Sharpeville by erasing the truth and calling it Human Rights Day, instead of what it is, a massacre. The fight of our people is for dignity which comes with land return. We don’t need paper rights. We need the land back. The Sharpeville protest is testament to Sobukwe’s capacity to inspire a people to revolt. He organised the people into resistance through his motto “Serve…Suffer…Sacrifice”. He was so effective that the apartheid regime isolated him from other political prisoners on Robben Island and passed a special law to keep him in jail. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) did not declare the pass laws to be the ultimate crime against black people and a violation of human rights. Had they done so, then the murderers would have been called to account, those massacred would have been acknowledged, and those affected would have been entitled to reparations. BLF demands that who suffered, those who lost families in the massacre must get reparations without delay. Pay the people! They have suffered enough!
