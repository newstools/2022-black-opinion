Image: Rob Hersov, and Penuel The Black Pen By Andile Mngxitama Everyone with some social media presence believes they are gods. Now the chommie of baas Rob Hersov, the sponsor of black on black violence, also believes himself to be a god. If you in the dark everything that sounds coherent impresses you. Penuel The Black Pen on Facebook I think this is a sickness of the 21st century, a delusion that comes with the number of likes. Also, claiming to be god can maybe make you some money by selling your own bible. It’s a business proposition. If you in the dark everything that sounds coherent impresses you.
