By Andile Mngxitama Now imperialism has shutdown Russian TV (RT) in the USA, Canada, and Europe. There is pressure on DSTV to do the same. Remember the first victim of the war against Zuma and the RET forces was ANN7 when it was shut down.The enemy understands the value of propaganda. Up to this day the figure of corruption is the Guptas and Jacob Zuma. That’s the power of propaganda. Right now they are busy shutting down Sekunjalo Independent Media, actually the whole Sekunjalo Group, because it’s not driven by the Stellenbosch agenda. Most people’s truth is the creation of enemy propaganda. Who to like, who to hate, are all controlled by the media.The first and most important war is the war over the mind. That’s why Biko said, “The most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed”. Free the mind to free the land! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
