He stands at the threshold of winning the presidency in May on a platform promising fair and equitable distribution of wealth, cutting oil and gas extraction, using tourist revenues to take the place of fuel profits and implementing Colombia’s 2016 peace deal with FARC. Petro won over four million votes in the primaries, while the right-wing contender Federico “Fico” Gutierrez, got about two million votes and Sergio Fajardo, the centrist, garnered just over 700,000 votes. In 2018, then campaigning for presidency under the Pacto Historico coalition, Petro lost to pro right-wing President Ivan Duque who won on a ticket that opposed the 2016 deal with the FARC guerrilla group that brought over half a century of war than end. His failure to make good on the peace deal has turned polls against him. Columbia is notably following the left regional trend in the path of countries such as Peru, Chile and Honduras in Latin America that have moved away from right wing presidential candidates. Whoever is victorious in the May presidential elections will replace President Duque. A victory for Petro will be a more than welcome result for the Columbian people who are speaking through and outside the polls that they have had enough and are ready for change.
