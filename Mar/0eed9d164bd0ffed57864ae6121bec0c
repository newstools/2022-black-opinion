Image: BLF President By Andile Mngxitama We need to jerk up our knowledge of the political history of our struggle. Do we even know that Stalin forced the racist SACP to adopt the slogan “black republic”? Of course the racist SACP resisted this formulation coming up with such wishy washy notions as “colonialism of a special type”. Trotsky provided further clarification of the slogan in his engagments with the South African communists. We need to study the political history of the SA struggle to avoid repeating the same mistakes over and over again. That the current SACP took the side of white capital in the battle between Zuma and the Guptas against white capital is part of the racist DNA of the SACP. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
