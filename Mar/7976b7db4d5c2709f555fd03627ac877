Over 1200 adverse side effects of Pfizer vaccine found by USFDA Black First Land First (BLF) calls on the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) to order the government to immediately suspend the Pfizer vaccination program. It is not enough to continue with the covid-19 vaccines as over 1200 serious side effects have been identified by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). BLF welcomes the initiative to investigate the matter but it’s not enough. What must accompany the investigation is an immediate suspension of the Pfizer vaccination program. The health of the nation is at stake. Serious and urgent steps must be taken to safeguard the nation. SAHPRA shall be failing in its duty if it fails to halt the dangerous Pfizer vaccines.
