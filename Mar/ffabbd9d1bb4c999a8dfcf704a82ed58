By Andile Mngxitama As black revolutionaries we do well to remember the weaknesses of Marxism when confronting the black body. Fanon’s teacher Aime Cesaire wrote the following when resigning from the French Communist Party:“What I want is that Marxism and communism be placed in the service of black people, and not black people in the service of Marxism and communism.” The history of the SACP shows how blacks have been put in service of racist communist projects. We provide this criticism not to reject Marxism but to decolonise it to serve blacks. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
