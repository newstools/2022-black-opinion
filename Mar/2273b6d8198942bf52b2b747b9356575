Image: BLF President By Andile Mngxitama So some amongst us don’t know Russia gave blacks military training, money and AK47s to help us fight for freedom? Know your friends from your enemies. Looks like we need a talk on the contributions of Russia to the liberation of the African continent from colonialism, including how they assisted in ending apartheid. People are ignorant about our history of liberation. Putin was sent to Africa to train freedom fighters.Lenin in the 3rd International committed the Soviet Union to fighting colonialism.Stalin chased the white representatives of the SACP asking them where are the natives?Know your history and you won’t be so easily misled. We stand with Russia! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF), a radical black consciousness organization.
