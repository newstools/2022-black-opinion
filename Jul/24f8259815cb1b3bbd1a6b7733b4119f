Image: Don Mattera Andile Mngxitama Ntate Don Mattera, the tower of Black Consciousness and Pan Afrikanism. He called out the name Biko and Sobukwe with equal reverence, the Black Power salute and open palm greetings.He who gave us the Azanian Love Song and reminded us that “memory is a weapon”. Ntate Mattera; Bra Don, you who called for the white children whose fathers stole the sea and the sand to repent before the chidren who lost the sea and lost all love for them. Your life tower is an example of a refutation of the liberal dictum that if you are a socialist beyond the age 30 you have brains. You had a warm heart and a razor sharp mind to the end. Hamba kahle Bro Don…. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF) a radical black consciousness organization.
