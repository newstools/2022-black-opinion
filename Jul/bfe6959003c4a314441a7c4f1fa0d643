Andile Mngxitama The enemy is getting clever. If we use this dictum without the caveat provided in the BLF “black code” we could easily be used by the enemy when it starts to reject its tools. The caveat is that the tool to get our support must repent and confess its sins against the black agenda. Our support for enemy agents is not unconditional. The enemy agent must reject the enemy and ask for forgiveness. In other words it must confess and repent. Otherwise it remains a tool of the oppressor, used and rejected. We have no business coming to its defence. The enemy is now rejecting Ramaphosa for its own reasons which are not the same with our reasons. The enemy is rejecting Ramaphosa to buy itself new legitimacy to continue its power. We must be aware always of the schemes of the enemy. We want Ramaphosa gone but not for the same reasons as the enemy.We must now proceed to say who must replace Ramaphosa or the enemy shall give us a substitute agent. Kushubile! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF) a radical black consciousness organization.
