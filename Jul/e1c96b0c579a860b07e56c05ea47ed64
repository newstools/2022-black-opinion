By Andile Mngxitama My account is “restricted” for 19 days for saying “the white boy did jack shit”. They say it’s for hate speech. We aren’t allowed to call white boys white boys. It’s the violence of white power to censor black speech that whitens white power. I was responding to someone who was talking about the white boy who was insulting Cele. Yerrr white racism goes into automatic self defense. Then you still have these house nig@#$ers defending white power. Fuck!
