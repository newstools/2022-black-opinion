Andile Mngxitama Was in Mark’s jail for 3 days for writing “wyt boy”. They are offended by the word. Whiteness is too defensive towards being whitened. It operates as a system of self denial to justify perpetrating atrocities. Whiteness hates being called out. It’s not comfortable with being named and made visible. It’s our job to make visible the invisible hand of white power. This is the only way we can get justice and reparations. White power doesn’t like being indentified. It’s an anonymous system of evil. That’s how it can self perpertuate. We must disrupt whiteness until it shows its evil hand more clearly so that our people can see what causes havock in our lives. Good morning. Have a great week ahead! Akabuyanga uMaxingwana… Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF) a radical black consciousness organization.
