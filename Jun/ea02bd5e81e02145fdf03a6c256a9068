Image: BLF President Andile Mngxitama Foreigners arrived here in 1652 and took our land and enslaved us. These same foreigners went up Africa taking land and enslaving other black people. The foreigner oppressed blacks for over 350 years. Keeping us in overcrowded townships and barren homelands. They kept all the wealth to themselves. Blacks had to work for the foreigner in order to eat. They gave fake polirical power to blacks in 1994 whilst keeping the mines, banks and land. Blacks in a neighbouring country took back their land. The whites destroyed their economy and forced them to scatter the world over looking for survival. Then the whites of SA employed them at starvation wages and made them to compete with the landless and poor victims for jobs offered by the white land thieves. Then the white land thieves decided to escalate the animosity of want they have created between their victims. They then set up a campaign to hunt the outsider victims with dogs calling them foreigners. The blacks who were made landless and hungry join the land thieves in the crusade against their victims from outside SA who are forced to leave their country because the whites who stole their land destroyed their economy. The blacks of SA join hands with the 1652 land thieves and eslavers to fight the recently victimised blacks. The system of dividing blacks which ensured colonialism and slavery succeeds, is repeated. Blacks side with their original tormentors against fellow blacks. The circle continues. Blacks have become efficient assistants of whites in perpertrating the oppression of blacks. Without ideology action is dangerous. Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF) a radical black consciousness organization.
