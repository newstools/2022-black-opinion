Andile Mngxitama We all must have seen the video of the creche teacher viciously assaulting a toddler. It’s possible the abuser is a mother with her own children. The circle is thus: The whiteman hits the black man on the head. The black man hits other black men and black women on their heads. The black woman hits the black child on the head. It’s a chain reaction top-down. The dynamic of the violence is rarely bottom-up. As the saying goes – hurt people hurt. We need two simultaneous interventions to break the circle. The first is black love. We have to learn to love ourselves first. When we do that we shall protect blacks first. Then we must also fight the white monster standing on our heads. We must free ourselves from the clutches of white power. That’s the only lasting solution. The war in the black zone must end!
