Andile Mngxitama In SA there are only two political forces. One is white supremacy currently managed by the ANC and protected by the SA constitution. The other is Black Power currently represented by the Black Consciousness organisations such BLF, AZAPO, BCM, PAC. The forces of white supremacy are united by an anti black agenda and may occassionaly display superficial disagreements eg EFF vs DA and their fight with the ANC. It’s a spectacle of deception in a pseudo fight. Their ultimate fight is about defending white power. The Black Power block is weakened by petty squabbles and egos of leadership. This leaves blacks vulnerable and exposed to deceptions and prolonged suffering.The Black Power block is the real answer to white power but it has to mature politically and articulate a minimum program of action against the main enemy. Without that unity we are doomed. This year must be the last year of separate commemorations. Biko died in a quest to unify the black liberation movement. We dare not fail. Black unity for Black Power!!! Andile Mngxitama is the President of Black First Land First (BLF) a radical black consciousness organization.
