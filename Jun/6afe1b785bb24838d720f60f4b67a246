The left-wing Historic Pact coalition led by Gustavo Petro and Francia Marquez have emerged victorious in the Colombian presidential elections. Petro will be the first left-wing president of the country which for decades has suffered under the rule of pro-US conservative politicians. Many see the victory as part of a broader leftward shift across the region following the period of neoliberal reactionary governments.Reposted from Peoples Dispatch publication of June 20, 2022
