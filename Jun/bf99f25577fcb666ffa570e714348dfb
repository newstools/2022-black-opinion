Andile Mngxitama Black people want wealth through “magical” ways. We fear the white man who has our land and wealth. We pray on the weak. In Mpumalanga at Hazyview 5 children have been murdered and their body parts sold to a Sangoma. These barbaric dark acts must stop. Money is in white hands. No amount of muti is going to change that. We really have to stop this barbarism.It’s so defeating the things we blacks do to each other really. And to think the mastermind of these killings is a woman and some of the children are her nieces.Lord we need help.
